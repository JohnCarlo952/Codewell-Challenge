            The combined experience i have working at the top fortune <br />
            500 companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that <br />
            helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any <br />
            business.
            <br />

            I'm proud to announce that i am now working at one of the <br />
            world's largest communities teaching young minds about how <br />
            to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new <br />
